    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>This project, <strong>'The Moon Awaits'</strong>, was created as part of my <strong>Three.js Bootcamp</strong>. During the bootcamp, I learned how to work with 3D models using Blender, export them as <strong>.glb</strong> files, and use <strong>Model Viewer</strong> to display them on a website.</p>
    
    <p>The project's objective is to give users a fun and instructive 3D lunar exploration experience. The Moon model used in this project is sourced from <strong>NASA's Open Data</strong>, allowing users to rotate, zoom, and inspect its surface in detail.</p>

    <p>This project demonstrates how to combine Three.js, Model Viewer, and web development to build immersive experiences and reflects my learning experience with 3D web technologies.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my project! ðŸš€</p>
